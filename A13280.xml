            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:18652:6"/>help, than now I could, to have made this a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and better poli≈øhed peece.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but it ≈øhall be found, in the advi≈øed and candide peru≈øall thereof, to carry in all the pa≈ø≈øages thereof the impre≈ø≈øe and ≈øtamp of <hi>truth;</hi> for which it may be worthy of your acceptation, both for <hi>informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>judgment;</hi> and al≈øo for <hi>direction</hi> of <hi>practice,</hi> in many important <hi>points</hi> and <hi>ca≈øes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although I did not obtrude it to the <hi>pre≈ø≈øe</hi> for publique u≈øe, upon mine owne meere <hi>motion,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øumptuous <hi>≈øelf-conceit;</hi> yet I need not make <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> for my publication thereof, from the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and furtherance of ≈øuch per≈øons, who≈øe worth of <hi>Judgement</hi> and power of <hi>godline≈ø≈øe</hi> is ≈øuch, as might be ≈øufficient to put mee forward to it; ≈øeeing that, in the≈øe dayes, wherein ≈øo many doe mo≈øt wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedly, and unnaturally <hi>kill</hi> them≈øelves, it is a <hi>Trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> too nece≈ø≈øarie and u≈øefull: which ≈øufficiently warrants mee, upon and with the approbation of the <hi>Church,</hi> to <hi>divulge</hi> the ≈øame to the worlds view and ≈øervice.</p>
            <p>Although many men of learning and worth, <hi>Ca≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øts, Schoolemen,</hi> and other <hi>Divines: Prote≈øtants, and Papi≈øts, Ancient</hi> and <hi>moderne, tran≈ømarine,</hi> and <hi>Dome≈øtick</hi> have occa≈øionally, or but brifely cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and condemned <hi>Self murder;</hi> yet I have met with no ≈øingle, nor compleat <hi>Treati≈øe</hi> of it.

<pb facs="tcp:18652:6"/>unprevented by others of a <hi>Birth</hi> and opportunity free for me to adventure to the <hi>Sea</hi> of publickne≈ø≈øe, I have imbarqued my ≈øelfe in this bottome of di≈ømall <hi>denomination</hi> from <hi>Self-killing;</hi> which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding ≈øpreads and carryes in the <hi>fore-top,</hi> and in the <hi>En≈øigne</hi> upon the <hi>Poup,</hi> the white and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Colours</hi> of <hi>Lifes pre≈øervation,</hi> having all her force and ordnance bent again≈øt <hi>Self-murder;</hi> to overcome and ≈øink the ≈øame; for which purpo≈øe it di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaies the <hi>Flagge</hi> of bloody <hi>colours again≈øt</hi> it in the <hi>maine Top</hi> of every page.

               <pb facs="tcp:18652:7"/>thereof, and the <hi>whole</hi> to the end, before you ra≈øhly cen≈øure, condemne, or reject any thing therein, upon the fir≈øt mi≈øtake; either of the <hi>matter,</hi> or of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> meaning.

            </p>
            <p>I affect not to ≈øtand upon the <hi>pinacle</hi> of publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe; objected to the contrary bla≈øts of every bodies impetuous <hi>cen≈øure,</hi> neither agreeing within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, nor many times with the truth; where <hi>pa≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, prejudices,</hi> or their owne private un≈øound <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and <hi>by-re≈øpects</hi> yeeld them the <hi>premi≈øes</hi> of their <hi>conclu≈øions.</hi>

            <p>Although I am, in ≈øome ≈øort, under an <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of ancient <hi>intention</hi> to have made ≈øome thing publick, about the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Practicall</hi> and <hi>Ca≈øe-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity;</hi> yet I may be excu≈øed for not performing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the precipitating <hi>zeale</hi> and bold undertakings of le≈ø≈øe con≈øiderate <hi>youth</hi> are often commendably mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated, or recalled, by more mature and beter advi≈øed <hi>age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find ≈øo much, and ≈øo wel, ≈øcatteredly done by <hi>others</hi> (of great worth for judgment, piety, and experience,) touching that ≈øubject; which collected into one body, out of their writings publick and private, may ≈øuffice.

            </p>
            <p>For the pre≈øent, this <hi>Tractate</hi> I commend to your u≈øe. And above all, as I ≈øtand mo≈øt bound, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to you my much re≈øpected <hi>Auditors</hi> and <hi>friends</hi> of my peculiar <hi>charge;</hi> whereupon I have faithfully, although in weake manner, attended and be≈øtowed my labours in my mini≈øtery the≈øe ≈øeaven and twenty yeares, and upward; (in ≈øucce≈øsion to a mo≈øt <hi>Reverend, Iudicious</hi> and <hi>godly Divine,</hi> a <hi>Father</hi> both to you and me,) endeavoring to doe you <hi>all</hi> the be≈øt ≈øervice and good that I could: and (I thank God) not without comfort of ≈øome fruit of my paines among you; although it be not ≈øo much as I would, for the ≈øalvation and welfare of you all; from whom neither any inte≈øtine <hi>di≈øcontents,</hi> nor externall <hi>invitations</hi> could ever hitherto prevaile to draw mee, to whom I found my ≈øelfe ≈øo ≈øtrongly obliged and tied, both by my comfortable calling, and the <hi>Churches order,</hi> to bee yours; and al≈øo by our mutuall entire affection and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpects each of us to other; begun with your <hi>Ance≈øtors,</hi> and continued with your ≈øelves as the ≈øame ought to be betweene a <hi>Mini≈øter</hi> and his pari≈øhioners or people.</p>
            <p>In which regard I leave and commend unto you this <hi>Treati≈øe,</hi> for a monument and witne≈ø≈øe, in times to come, of remembrance of your <hi>true</hi> and <hi>deare Friend;</hi> who≈øe la≈øt farewell, he would be loath ≈øhould be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with this le≈ø≈øe-plea≈øant <hi>≈øubject.</hi> Wherein (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øe) my care is mo≈øt for you, that you may have bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, by that now ≈øubjected to your <hi>eyes;</hi> which for the mo≈øt part of it, you have heard ≈øounding in your <hi>cares.</hi>

                  <p>Al≈øo the e≈øtimate of the greatne≈ø≈øe and unpardonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of ≈øinnes as they are in <hi>offenders,</hi> is not wholly to be made by con≈øideration of their <hi>ab≈øtract nature;</hi> but ≈øpecially the ≈øame is to bee made by the <hi>quality</hi> and <hi>di≈øpo≈øition</hi> of the <hi>committers</hi> of them, who≈øe <hi>per≈øonall</hi> and <hi>actionall</hi> circum≈øtances in doing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, much <hi>aggravats,</hi> or extenuats the ≈øame.

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:18652:172"/>the <hi>offenders,</hi> than upon the <hi>nature</hi> of their ≈øins; ab≈øolutly and ab≈øtractly con≈øidered, the <hi>fact</hi> of <hi>≈øelf murder</hi> is ≈øuch a ≈øinne, as no man penitently di≈øpo≈øed can commit, and it cuts him (that doth it) off finally from all repentance, and con≈øequently from ≈øalvation.</p>

                     <hi>Of</hi> all ≈øinnes again≈øt the <hi>Law, ≈øelf-murder</hi> is mo≈øt dangerous and pernicious for a mans ≈øoule, to bring it to damnation: both becau≈øe, it excludes all care, and meanes of a mans ≈øalvation, which if a <hi>≈øelf-murderer</hi> did regard, he would not venture in the la≈øt period of his life, upon a cour≈øe ≈øo contrary to it; and al≈øo, it puts the <hi>≈øelf-murderer</hi> into ≈øuch an e≈øtate and di≈øpo≈øition of ≈øinfulne≈ø≈øe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øene≈ø≈øe from God and his will, in pur≈øuing of his owne wicked lu≈øt, that he is not, nor can be capable of grace, nor is in the way of ≈øalvation, whereunto ≈øelf-murder is mo≈øt contrary, by his la≈øt act of horrible ≈øin, in the clo≈øure of his life.</p>
