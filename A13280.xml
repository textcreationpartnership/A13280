            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Although I did not obtrude it to the <hi>preſſe</hi> for publique uſe, upon mine owne meere <hi>motion,</hi> or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous <hi>ſelf-conceit;</hi> yet I need not make <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi> for my publication thereof, from the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and furtherance of ſuch perſons, whoſe worth of <hi>Judgement</hi> and power of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> is ſuch, as might be ſufficient to put mee forward to it; ſeeing that, in theſe dayes, wherein ſo many doe moſt wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedly, and unnaturally <hi>kill</hi> themſelves, it is a <hi>Trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> too neceſſarie and uſefull: which ſufficiently warrants mee, upon and with the approbation of the <hi>Church,</hi> to <hi>divulge</hi> the ſame to the worlds view and ſervice.</p>
            <p>Although many men of learning and worth, <hi>Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, Schoolemen,</hi> and other <hi>Divines: Proteſtants, and Papiſts, Ancient</hi> and <hi>moderne, tranſmarine,</hi> and <hi>Domeſtick</hi> have occaſionally, or but brifely cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and condemned <hi>Self murder;</hi> yet I have met with no ſingle, nor compleat <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeeing how requiſite and needfull it is that there were in theſe dayes, ſuch an entire <hi>Tractate</hi> of that <hi>ſubject,</hi> when as of moſt other <hi>ſubjects,</hi> and of many leſſe neceſſary there is a ſurcharge of <hi>bookes</hi> and pamphlets; and finding my ſelfe, in this particular
<pb facs="tcp:18652:6"/>unprevented by others of a <hi>Birth</hi> and opportunity free for me to adventure to the <hi>Sea</hi> of publickneſſe, I have imbarqued my ſelfe in this bottome of diſmall <hi>denomination</hi> from <hi>Self-killing;</hi> which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſpreads and carryes in the <hi>fore-top,</hi> and in the <hi>Enſigne</hi> upon the <hi>Poup,</hi> the white and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Colours</hi> of <hi>Lifes preſervation,</hi> having all her force and ordnance bent againſt <hi>Self-murder;</hi> to overcome and ſink the ſame; for which purpoſe it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaies the <hi>Flagge</hi> of bloody <hi>colours againſt</hi> it in the <hi>maine Top</hi> of every page. And thus I have, for the good both of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-weale,</hi> and of the <hi>ſoules</hi> and <hi>bodies</hi> of men, (all which this <hi>ſubject</hi> doth neerly concerne,) adventured to commit my ſelf to the ſtormie and unconſtant Ship-wrecking <hi>Ocean</hi> of this tumultuous and tempeſtuous world, under the <hi>ſailes</hi> of the <hi>preſſe,</hi> with flowen ſheets, <hi>quò fata fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi> whither divine <hi>providence</hi> will carry me. I pray for <hi>heavens favour;</hi> for the <hi>worlds faire wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and for a proſperous <hi>voyage:</hi> deſiring that my <hi>auſpicable</hi> attempt may occaſion and provoke <hi>others</hi> of better abilities to perfect my good meaning and weake <hi>Aſſay,</hi> by their more exquiſite performances; and that my <hi>ſelfe</hi> may not be diſcouraged, by counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaſts, or ill ſucceſſe, in my firſt ſetting ſaile out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>worlds</hi> view.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Contents</hi> and <hi>worth</hi> of the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> will bee apparent to the judicious <hi>Readers,</hi> upon the adviſed peruſall thereof: and the <hi>fruit</hi> of the ſame will ſhew it ſelfe, in the <hi>Effects</hi> of it: and according to your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme in <hi>both,</hi> I doubt not but you will entertaine and regard it. I pray you read conſideratly every <hi>paſſage</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18652:7"/>thereof, and the <hi>whole</hi> to the end, before you raſhly cenſure, condemne, or reject any thing therein, upon the firſt miſtake; either of the <hi>matter,</hi> or of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> meaning. What ſhall be, upon good <hi>reaſons,</hi> manifeſted to me to be therein amiſſe, I will willingly endeavour to amend and correct; with reſpective thankfulneſſe to the <hi>Informer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I affect not to ſtand upon the <hi>pinacle</hi> of publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; objected to the contrary blaſts of every bodies impetuous <hi>cenſure,</hi> neither agreeing within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor many times with the truth; where <hi>paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, prejudices,</hi> or their owne private unſound <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and <hi>by-reſpects</hi> yeeld them the <hi>premiſes</hi> of their <hi>concluſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although I am, in ſome ſort, under an <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of ancient <hi>intention</hi> to have made ſome thing publick, about the <hi>body</hi> of <hi>Practicall</hi> and <hi>Caſe-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity;</hi> yet I may be excuſed for not performing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the precipitating <hi>zeale</hi> and bold undertakings of leſſe conſiderate <hi>youth</hi> are often commendably mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated, or recalled, by more mature and beter adviſed <hi>age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find ſo much, and ſo wel, ſcatteredly done by <hi>others</hi> (of great worth for judgment, piety, and experience,) touching that ſubject; which collected into one body, out of their writings publick and private, may ſuffice. And alſo I doe perceive that it may be hurtfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the difficultie of it, to deſcend particularly and punctually to the ſpeciall definite and publick determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in <hi>Print,</hi> of all incident <hi>caſes,</hi> as the ſame may be diverſified, by their ſeverall <hi>circumſtances</hi> and <hi>accidents:</hi> whereupon I have beene hitherto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
<pb facs="tcp:18652:7"/>from that taske; which requires the united wiſdome and experience of all the moſt <hi>practically-ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious, pious,</hi> and <hi>profound Divines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the preſent, this <hi>Tractate</hi> I commend to your uſe. And above all, as I ſtand moſt bound, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to you my much reſpected <hi>Auditors</hi> and <hi>friends</hi> of my peculiar <hi>charge;</hi> whereupon I have faithfully, although in weake manner, attended and beſtowed my labours in my miniſtery theſe ſeaven and twenty yeares, and upward; (in ſucceſsion to a moſt <hi>Reverend, Iudicious</hi> and <hi>godly Divine,</hi> a <hi>Father</hi> both to you and me,) endeavoring to doe you <hi>all</hi> the beſt ſervice and good that I could: and (I thank God) not without comfort of ſome fruit of my paines among you; although it be not ſo much as I would, for the ſalvation and welfare of you all; from whom neither any inteſtine <hi>diſcontents,</hi> nor externall <hi>invitations</hi> could ever hitherto prevaile to draw mee, to whom I found my ſelfe ſo ſtrongly obliged and tied, both by my comfortable calling, and the <hi>Churches order,</hi> to bee yours; and alſo by our mutuall entire affection and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects each of us to other; begun with your <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> and continued with your ſelves as the ſame ought to be betweene a <hi>Miniſter</hi> and his pariſhioners or people.</p>
            <p>In which regard I leave and commend unto you this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> for a monument and witneſſe, in times to come, of remembrance of your <hi>true</hi> and <hi>deare Friend;</hi> whoſe laſt farewell, he would be loath ſhould be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with this leſſe-pleaſant <hi>ſubject.</hi> Wherein (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) my care is moſt for you, that you may have bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, by that now ſubjected to your <hi>eyes;</hi> which for the moſt part of it, you have heard ſounding in your <hi>cares.</hi>

            <pb facs="tcp:18652:8"/>

For, as <hi>the tree falls, ſo it ſhall lye,</hi> there is no amendment of our eſtate and errors after <hi>death:</hi> as appeares by the <hi>parable</hi> of the <hi>rich man, Luke</hi> 16.25, 26. if <hi>God</hi> doe give a man <hi>life</hi> and <hi>time,</hi> he puts a <hi>price</hi> into his hand, and gives him a great bleſſing, for his advancement to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Although that ſuch <hi>ſilence,</hi> or not anſwering directly may be conſtrued to be an acknowledgement of the <hi>fact,</hi> that he is indited for; yet thereby he ſhall not be <hi>active,</hi> but onely <hi>paſſive</hi> in being found guilty, and ſo condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die; whereby he ſhall be free of <hi>indirect ſelf-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> in that reſpect.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>confeſſion</hi> of a <hi>malefactor,</hi> upon examination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> when the ſame is againſt his owne life, may bee conſtrued to have beene either raſhly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably done by the <hi>Examinate;</hi> againſt which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is allowed at his <hi>Triall</hi> to <hi>plead not guilty:</hi> or elſe that hee did the ſame upon ſome motives and reaſons of <hi>conſcience,</hi> for the good and ſalvation of his <hi>ſoule:</hi> which are things properly belonging to another <hi>Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, in humane <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Aſſize,</hi> the <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions</hi> and <hi>anſwers</hi> (in this caſe) reach not ſo farre as to rack, or diſcover the <hi>conſcience</hi> of a man, to the taking away of his owne life, by his owne <hi>confeſſion,</hi> which the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> and of <hi>God</hi> binds a man to preſerve.</p>
                  <p>Although a <hi>capitall malefactor</hi> is bound in conſcience not to <hi>lie</hi> in his anſwers, yet he is not bound to reveale all the truth he knowes againſt himſelfe; ſpecially where hee is not tied by ſome ſpeciall <hi>divine</hi> bond ſo to doe.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>negative</hi> anſwer at <hi>triall</hi> is as ſtrong to ſave a man, as his former <hi>affirmative</hi> in confeſſion before a <hi>Iuſtice</hi> can be to condemne him; except either he publickly at

And doe you thinke it is not a greater contempt of God for a man to deſpiſe his gift? For, we of him received our firſt beeing, and from him let us expect our ending. The body is mortall, framed of corruptible matter; but our ſoules are immortall, and there is a little part of God placed in our bodies.

For, <hi>pardon,</hi> or not <hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>ſins</hi> depends more upon the penitencie, or impenitency of
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:18652:172"/>the <hi>offenders,</hi> than upon the <hi>nature</hi> of their ſins; abſolutly and abſtractly conſidered, the <hi>fact</hi> of <hi>ſelf murder</hi> is ſuch a ſinne, as no man penitently diſpoſed can commit, and it cuts him (that doth it) off finally from all repentance, and conſequently from ſalvation.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Self-murder moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for a mans ſoule.</note>
                     <hi>Of</hi> all ſinnes againſt the <hi>Law, ſelf-murder</hi> is moſt dangerous and pernicious for a mans ſoule, to bring it to damnation: both becauſe, it excludes all care, and meanes of a mans ſalvation, which if a <hi>ſelf-murderer</hi> did regard, he would not venture in the laſt period of his life, upon a courſe ſo contrary to it; and alſo, it puts the <hi>ſelf-murderer</hi> into ſuch an eſtate and diſpoſition of ſinfulneſſe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe from God and his will, in purſuing of his owne wicked luſt, that he is not, nor can be capable of grace, nor is in the way of ſalvation, whereunto ſelf-murder is moſt contrary, by his laſt act of horrible ſin, in the cloſure of his life.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>therefore,</hi> it is apparent that, for any thing in this <hi>objection</hi> alledged, there is nothing from the nature of the ſin of ſelf-murder, properly ſo called, that can give any comfort of ſalvation to <hi>ſelf-murderers,</hi> or can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant us to hold probably, and in the judgement of charity, that they are not all (generally conſidered) utterly damned.</p>
